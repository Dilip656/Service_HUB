## API Endpoints Enhanced

### Payment Gateway Routes
1. **POST** `/api/razorpay/create-order`
   - Creates real Razorpay orders
   - Returns order ID, amount, currency, and key
   - Handles both demo and real modes

2. **POST** `/api/razorpay/verify-payment`
   - Verifies payment signatures
   - Updates booking status
   - Creates payment records

3. **GET** `/api/razorpay/key`
   - Securely provides Razorpay key to frontend
   - Used for real payment integration

## Testing Results

### Real API Tests (Successful)
```bash
# Key Retrieval Test
curl /api/razorpay/key
Response: {"key":"rzp_test_YkLKCKq0VmkEdh"}

# Order Creation Test  
curl -X POST /api/razorpay/create-order -d '{"amount":100}'
Response: {
  "success": true,
  "order_id": "order_R3zCkfV0opxL27",
  "amount": 10000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "key": "rzp_test_YkLKCKq0VmkEdh"
}
```
