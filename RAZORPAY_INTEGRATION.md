## Frontend Implementation

### Payment Test Page

Located at `/payment-test`, this page provides a complete payment testing interface with:

- Amount input with validation
- Razorpay Checkout.js integration
- Real-time payment status updates
- Test card details for safe testing
- Success/failure handling with detailed information

### Key Features

1. **Script Loading**: Dynamically loads Razorpay Checkout.js
2. **Order Creation**: Creates order via backend API
3. **Payment Modal**: Opens Razorpay's secure payment interface
4. **Signature Verification**: Verifies payment authenticity
5. **Database Integration**: Automatically saves payment records
6. **Status Updates**: Updates booking status on successful payment

### Test Card Details

For testing in Razorpay's test mode:
- **Card Number:** 4111 1111 1111 1111
- **Expiry:** Any future date
- **CVV:** Any 3 digits
- **Name:** Any name

## Database Integration

### Payment Record Storage

Successful payments are automatically stored in the `payments` table with:
- Payment ID from Razorpay
- Order ID and transaction details
- User and provider information
- Amount and currency
- Payment method and gateway
- Transaction status and timestamps

### Booking Status Updates

When a payment is successful:
1. Payment record is created in database
2. Associated booking status is updated to "Confirmed"
3. Provider receives booking notification

## Security Features

### Signature Verification

All payments are verified using HMAC SHA256 signature verification:

```javascript
const body = razorpay_order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id;
const expectedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET!)
  .update(body.toString())
  .digest("hex");
```

### Environment Protection

- API keys are stored as environment variables
- Keys never exposed to client-side code
- Secure HTTPS communication in production

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors
- Invalid amount validation
- Order creation failures
- Payment verification failures
- Database operation errors

### Frontend Errors
- Script loading failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Payment gateway errors
- User cancellation handling

## Integration with Existing Features

### Booking System Integration

The payment system integrates seamlessly with the existing booking workflow:

1. User selects service and provider from `/services` page
2. User fills booking details on `/booking` page
3. After successful booking creation, Razorpay payment modal opens automatically
4. User completes payment through Razorpay Checkout.js interface
5. On successful payment:
   - Payment is verified with signature authentication
   - Booking status is updated to "Confirmed"
   - Payment record is saved to database
   - User is redirected to dashboard
   - Provider receives booking notification

### Admin Dashboard

Admins can monitor all payments through:
